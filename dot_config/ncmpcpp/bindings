# ncmpcpp Bindings (Vim-inspired)
#
# To use these bindings:
# 1. Save this file as 'bindings' in your ncmpcpp config directory (e.g., ~/.config/ncmpcpp/)
# 2. Ensure the line `bindings_file = "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/ncmpcpp/bindings"`
#    is present in your main `ncmpcpp/config` file.
# 3. Restart ncmpcpp.
